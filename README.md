# 🧠 KlinePro Product Matching Challenge — Team 3: *The Inference Club*

Welcome to the official repository for the **Klinepro Product Matching Challenge**.  
This repository contains experiments, solution notebooks, and performance evaluations contributed by **Team 3: _The Inference Club_**.

## 🧩 Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to **accurately match product descriptions (SKUs)** across large and diverse catalogs using techniques from **NLP, semantic search, and vector similarity**.

### 🔹 Problem Summary:
- Match a given product/query with the most relevant SKU(s) from a master catalog.
- Handle **ambiguous product titles**, **multi-lingual or noisy data**, and **uneven distribution** (long-tail SKUs).
- Ensure **high precision** in single-ID cases and **recall coverage** in multi-ID cases.
- Support scalable inference using **retrieval + re-ranking** pipelines.
